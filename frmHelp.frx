якThe following describes how to use different special 
keys for bruteforce

Sends one or more keystrokes to 
the active window 
as if typed at the keyboard.
Remarks

Practise it first by using a program like Notepad and then do it on the real thing
Scroll down to see more of the special keys supported
You can use this program to break into a lost password like that of a WinZip password 
protected file.
And I hope this program works nicely. 
To make the program pause for some time give a key to repeat an unused key like f12 
some 1000 time so that the system can slow down a bit.I will soon improve the program 
so that the setup text box will be a multiline text box and that also would soon include a 
command for making a pause. Right now i have my university exams.So would not be 
able to spent more time soon. But I hope that i would soon be able to update this buggy 
program
Each key is represented by one or more characters. 
To specify a single keyboard character, use the 
character itself. For example, to represent the letter A, 
use "A" for string. To represent more than one 
character, append each additional character to the 
one preceding it. To represent the letters A, B, and C, 
use "ABC" for string.

The plus sign (+), caret (^), percent sign (%), tilde (~), 
and parentheses ( ) have special meanings to 
BruteForce. To specify one of these characters, 
enclose it within braces ({}). For example, to specify 
the plus sign, use {+}. Brackets ([ ]) have no special 
meaning to BruteForce, but you must enclose them in 
braces. In other applications, brackets do have a 
special meaning that may be significant when 
dynamic data exchange (DDE) occurs. To specify 
brace characters, use {{} and {}}.

To specify characters that aren't displayed when you 
press a key, such as ENTER or TAB, and keys that 
represent actions rather than characters, use the 
codes shown below:

Key      Code

 

BACKSPACE        {BACKSPACE}, {BS}, or {BKSP}

BREAK   {BREAK}

CAPS LOCK         {CAPSLOCK}

DEL or DELETE      {DELETE} or {DEL}

DOWN ARROW     {DOWN}

END       {END}

ENTER    {ENTER}or ~

ESC       {ESC}

HELP      {HELP}

HOME     {HOME}

INS or INSERT       {INSERT} or {INS}

LEFT ARROW       {LEFT}

NUM LOCK           {NUMLOCK}

PAGE DOWN        {PGDN}

PAGE UP {PGUP}

PRINT SCREEN      {PRTSC}

RIGHT ARROW      {RIGHT}

SCROLL LOCK      {SCROLLLOCK}

TAB       {TAB}

UP ARROW          {UP}

F1         {F1}

F2         {F2}

F3         {F3}

F4         {F4}

F5         {F5}

F6         {F6}

F7         {F7}

F8         {F8}

F9         {F9}

F10        {F10}

F11        {F11}

F12        {F12}

F13        {F13}

F14        {F14}

F15        {F15}

F16        {F16}

      

To specify keys combined with any combination of 
the SHIFT, CTRL, and ALT keys, precede the key 
code with one or more of the following codes:

Key      Code

 

SHIFT     +

CTRL      ^

ALT       %

      

To specify that any combination of SHIFT, CTRL, 
and ALT should be held down while several other 
keys are pressed, enclose the code for those keys in 
parentheses. For example, to specify to hold down 
SHIFT while E and C are pressed, use "+(EC)". To 
specify to hold down SHIFT while E is pressed, 
followed by C without SHIFT, use "+EC".

To specify repeating keys, use the form {key 
number}. You must put a space between key and 
number. For example, {LEFT 42} means press the 
LEFT ARROW key 42 times; {h 10} means press H 
10 times.

Note   You can't use BruteForce to send keystrokes 
to an application that is not designed to run in 
Microsoft Windows. BruteForce also can't send the 
PRINT SCREEN key {PRTSC} to any application.
